Comments: The terms of C++ functions and Java methods confuses me. The assignment was easy at first because all I did was input a number and determine if that number
was a perfect number. Then I realized it loops through all numbers UNTIL the inputted number, so I had to look up how to find factors of a number then implementing
an input validation with a try..catch exception.
